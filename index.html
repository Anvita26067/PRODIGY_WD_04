            <div class="about-details">
                <p>I am Anvita Sharma. I was born and brought up in Meerut. I am a third-year B.Tech student specializing in data science at Bennett University. As for my family, I come from a service family background; both my parents are in the government sector, which has added to my value system. Thatâ€™s why I know the importance of money and time management. Coming to myself, I am very keen on learning about technology and love to excel individually as well as in teams. Some of my core skills include problem-solving and adaptability. A few of my hobbies that I love to do in my free time are cooking, listening to music, swimming, and going to the gym as they keep me fit and mentally creative.</p>
